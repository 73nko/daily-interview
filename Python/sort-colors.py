# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:
#
# Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place
# so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
#
# Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
#
# Note: You are not suppose to use the libraryâ€™s sort function for this problem.
#
# Can you do this in a single pass?
