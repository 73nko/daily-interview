# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Twitter:

# A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards.
# Given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

# Example:
# Input: "banana"
# Output: "anana"

# Input: "million"
# Output: "illi"

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        if s is '':
            return s
        self.maxLength = 0
        self.start = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            # Check for odd length palindromes
            self.expandFromCenter(s, i, i)
            # Check for even length palindromes
            self.expandFromCenter(s, i, i+1)
        return s[self.start:self.start+self.maxLength]

    # Helper function to expand a substring around a central character or characters.
    def expandFromCenter(self, s, low, high):
        while low > -1 and high < len(s) and s[low] == s[high]:
            low -= 1
            high += 1
        # Check to see if we found a longer palindrome than our current counter.
        # Adjust maxLength and start index to counteract increment from while loop.
        if self.maxLength < high-low-1:
            self.maxLength = high-low-1
            self.start = low+1


# Test program
s = "tracecars"
print(str(Solution().longestPalindrome(s)))
# racecar
